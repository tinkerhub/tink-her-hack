            What started as Kerala's first women-only overnight hackathon with 500 curious minds turned into something
            bigger. <strong>Five venues</strong> lit up as women proved they could build technology, many writing their
            first lines of code.

          <p>
            The spark became a movement. 1,200 women across <strong>28 venues</strong> built 300 projects in a single
            night. From college students to working professionals, they showed up, stayed up, and built up. Some landed
            tech roles, others started ventures, but all of them proved - women belong in tech.
